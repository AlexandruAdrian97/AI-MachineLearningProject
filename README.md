# Artificial-Intelligence-ProjectML

The program is written in Python and it is a project developed for the Artificial Intelligence course at the university.

You will need to have some texts translated from diffrent languages into english. I have a train data folder with over 2800 text examples for this to make it work better.

The program takes from the train data 80% of the texts and turn them into training data and the rest put them to test to see if it can make it right.

I use two classifier for this program, Neural Networks (MLP) and SVM.

After the training it will know the labels for each of the train data text and it will take the most 20000 frequent words from them and try to classify the rest of 20%.

I use a K-FOLD Cross-Validation to improve my accuracy.
